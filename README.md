Title: Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System 
Framework: Keras with Tensorflow as Backend
Dataset used in paper: UIDs, XiaoDu, MTurk (None available online)
Dataset used in my implementation: LibriSpeech
Link to Dataset: http://www.openslr.org/12/ (I have not included the dataset since it is >10GB) Trained the model with 251 speakers

Lowest Loss reported for Convolutional Model: 1.23
Lowest Loss reported for Recurrent Model: 1.34
Loss for Softmax Pretraining + triplet loss: Not yet combined 

List of Files:
input.py - Includes reading an audio file, preprocessing and loading batches of triplets for inputs to model
conv_model.py - Convolutional Resnet network Implementation
recurrent_model.py - GRU network Implementation
Pretraining.py - Softmax Pretraining for the models triplet_loss.py - Implementation of triplet loss for the network

Corrections to be done/Modification to be added:
• Batch-size: Although triplet loss tends to converge with larger batches, due to memory constraints a batch size of 12 (12*3 for triplets) was used.
• Generating Triplets: Generates random triplets from the dataset. Modification needed to generate hard and semi- hard triplets.
• Triplet Loss: Standard Triplet loss implementation. Modification needed to make it lossless.
• Parameters for audio processing: Needs work to extract the best behaviour of the model.
• Data Set: trained the model on a subset of training data. The complete set of data could be
used to get better convergence
• Truncation: Truncated audio signal to 3 seconds due to memory constraints. Can include the
whole audio to get better results.
• Generating Pairs: Generating all pairs will make the problem trivial , since the set will contain a
lot of easy pairs when compared to hard pairs. Can modify the network to work on pairs for
comparison.
• Convolutional model: The inputs to the model can be varied in size to compare results. Used the minimum size possible.
• Imbalance in Classes: Dataset needs to be accounted for the imbalance in classes.
Oversampling, under sampling or stratified sampling could be adopted.
